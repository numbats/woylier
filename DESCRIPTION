Description: This method generates a tour path by interpolating between d-D frames in p-D 
  using Givens rotations. The algorithm is arises from the problem of zero'ing elements of 
  a matrix. This interpolation method is useful for showing specific d-D frames in the tour, 
  as opposed to d-D planes, as done by the geodesic interpolation. It is useful for 
  projection pursuit indexes which are not rotationally invariant.
